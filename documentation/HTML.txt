HTML
HTML is the language used for creating documents on the World Wide Web.
It defines the structure of a webpage and the content semantically. 
Past practices of web development includes specifications for the presentational aspects
of a webpage, however, in the present times, it is a good practice to
solely use HTML to specify the logical organization of a document and
the to hand over presentational aspects to stylesheets.
