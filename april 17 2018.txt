Server Side Web Scripting (SSWS)
- commonly used in web development that includes deployment of scripts in web servers. 
- produces responses to the user clients.

Java Servlets
- handles client requests by generating responses to such requests.
- applications implemented on web servers.
- part of the Java Enterprise Edition (EE), which are used for transaction-based applications.
- hosted in a servlet container that provides the environment which the servlet runs, as well as controls the 'servlet lifecycle'.


Java Servlet 3.1 (Java EE 7)
The servlet lifecycle
~ instantiation >> constructor call 
	the constructor call 
		-creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests
		-invoked implicitly by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service client request and no instance currently exists. 
~ initialization >> init() method 
	invoked only once intended for any start up init code
~ request handling >> service() method
	invoked for each client request
	performs whatever logic to serve request and generate response
	multi-threaded servlet instance; 'thread safe'
~ destruction >> destroy() method
	invoked before servlet instance is 'unloaded', housekeeping cleanup code.

HTTP Servlets
- handles HTTP request and generates responses 
- hosted in a web container, that takes cares of HTTP Requests conversion to HTTP Responses
- service() method call is routed to a doXXX() call
	doXXX calls are: doGet,doPost,doPut,doDelete,doTrace,doOptions,doHead
	the doXXX call requires two arguments
		1. HTTPServletRequest
		2. HTTPServletResponse
